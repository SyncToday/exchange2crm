Mobile workers sometimes need to quickly save the contact to CRM. Every mobile phone allows easily to create a contact e.g. [to save a number from a received call](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/product/lumia925/userguidance/?action=singleTopic&topic=GUID-FDA9F285-8A9F-471B-BBC8-A73DD7BC2935).

A lot of companies prefer to store their contact in the cloud to make sure their are accessible from everywhere and protected at the same time. [Office 365 supports almost every Internet-capable phone and tablet](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-mobile-setup-Help-7dabb6cb-0046-40b6-81fe-767e0b1f014f).

Mobile workers can use [CRM for phones and tablets](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/crm-customer-center/install-crm-for-phones-and-tablets.aspx) on their supported mobile devices however there is no such simple option to create a contact and assign it to the parent company.

Exchange2CRM import contacts from Office 365 Exchange to Microsoft Dynamics CRM and if the parent company is found, it will assign the contact to the parent company. It is an ideal companion to [the CRM server-side sync](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/crm-customer-center/synchronizing-data-with-outlook-or-exchange-faq.aspx).
